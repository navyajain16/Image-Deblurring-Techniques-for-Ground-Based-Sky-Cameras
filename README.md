### Dataset
In this paper we have used Singapore Whole‚Äêsky Imaging Categories (SWIMCAT) dataset. The dataset consists of $784$ cloud images classified into 5 classes, namely, clear sky, pattern clouds, thick dark clouds, thick white clouds, and veil clouds of size 125X125 pixels.

### Executive summary
In this paper we have applied various image deblurring algorithms to the SWIMCAT dataset and extensively analyzed their effects on different cloud types. 

Our approach is as follows:
1. First we apply various deblurring algorithms to images blurred synthetically with Gaussian Blur. 
2. Then we analyzed the results obtained both subjectively (Mannually) and objectively (Using PSNR and SSIM metrics).

### Environment 
This project was tested on `python 3.8` and MATLAB 2021b.
